A simple, yet, kick ass WordPress Plugin that scans your website automatically for malware, traces the threat, and blocks the IP Address of the attacker via Virus Total.

You must have a VirusTotal account with either a public or premium API key in order to use the plugin.

This plugin will do the following:

1. It will give you the option to scan the website for malware once.
2. It will give you additional options to scan the website automatically once every hour, or day, or week.
3. If it detects malware, it will give you the option to contain or delete the file.
4. If it detects malware, it will trace where the malware came from.
5. If it links the malware to a specific user, it will automatically block the IP Address of the user.

I will be adding additional features in the near future as this plugin will be an ongoing project. Any suggestions is appreciated.
